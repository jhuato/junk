Presentation (see Grundrisse for a contrast between investigation and presentation) is a pedagogic effort.  You, the author or presenter, are trying to show, share, illustrate, and convince the reader.  Therefore, one must motivate interest at first by allusion to a concrete thing that puzzles us.  Then one must switch gears and go for the essential abstraction on which the whole edifice is to be built.  This is the approach followed by Enders'() \emph{Applied Econometric Time Series}, Wiley: 

``I believe in teaching by induction. The method is to take a simple example and build towards more general and more complicated models and econometric procedures. Detailed examples of each procedure are provided. Each concludes with a step-by-step summary of the stages typically employed in using that procedure. The approach is one of learning by doing.''
